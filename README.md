Defining this repository is tricky. I hope you like it and if you can improve a component leave me an issue.

I really appreciate if you leave me a star, this repository is free and i don't have any kind of license. I have simply created it with the HTML,CSS and Javascript.

This project aims at being a complete, end-to-end solution for the functioning, and management of the NGO, which is a not-for-profit organization founded in order to improve the lives and livelihoods of people from the vulnerable, marginalized and under-developed sections of the society.

The intent of this project is to provide an efficient tool from the persective of the 5 different types of users: Donors, Volunteers, Fundraisers ,poor and the needy ones and the Management.
